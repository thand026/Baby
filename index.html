                Dear Valentine <br>
                Thank you for accepting my offer to be my Valentine. Each year, we come together to celebrate the love we have for each other. And this year is no different. <br>
                Ever since I met you, I've been growing more and more like a tree. Each day we talk is like watering that tree and you've been watering this tree for 3 long years. That is a very long time and I've become a very beautiful tree thanks to the most beautiful woman I know. And because of that, your love has become my greatest treasure. One that I will treasure for as long as I live.
                <br>
                Thank you for being my guiding light through the darkness we face everyday. You used to call me your light and I find it fitting that you are now <b>my</b> guiding light. <br>
                And as much as I know that is may be a short thing, I still hope that you love and enjoy it. <br>
                With that all being said, I hope you enjoy the rest of your gift.
                I love you

                Excuse Me?
            </h2>

            <p>
                I know you didn't just say no to me your boyfriend after you just asked me to ask you. I shouldn't even put an option for you to say no. I should just put Yes and Yes. <br>
                But for the fun of it I'm just going to assume that was a mistake so don't bother to even say no. <br> Got it?
            </p>
